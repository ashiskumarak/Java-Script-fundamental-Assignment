Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ans:
----
Javascript has five primitive data types these are Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined

✔ Number:
    The number data type represents numeric values.It can include integers, float and special values like NAN and infinity.
    Ex:
        let myNum=45;
        letMyflot=12.25;
        let notNum=Nan;
        let infi=infinity;

✔ String:
  The string data type represents sequences of characters enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (` `) 
  quotes. Strings are used to represent text data.
  Ex:
        let name="Ashis";
        let address='Bangalore';
        let literanex='my name is ${name}';

✔ Boolean:
  The boolean data type has only two values, true and false, and is used to represent logical values. Booleans are 
   commonly used for conditions and comparisons.
   Ex:
       let islogged=true;
       let isvalid=false;

✔ Null:
  The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value or a value that has been explicitly set 
  to indicate no value. It is often used to initialize variables before assigning meaningful values.
   Ex:
       let address=null;

✔ Undefined:
  The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is 
   often the initial value of variables.
   Ex:
        let Name;
