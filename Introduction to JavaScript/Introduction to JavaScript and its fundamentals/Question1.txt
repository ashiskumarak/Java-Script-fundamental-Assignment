 Question: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

✔ Java script is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used in web development.
✔ Its fundamental role is to enhance the web pages by adding interactivity and dynamic behaviour.
✔ JavaScript runs directly in web browsers, allowing developers to create features such as
   form validation, animations and realtime updates.

✔ JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the webpage's structure.
✔ This interaction enables developers manipulate and modify webpage content, styles and layout in response to user action.
✔  JavaScript also handles events, making it possible to create interactive web applications.

✔ JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, crucial for tasks like sending and receiving data from web servers without blocking the user interface.
✔ It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks such as React and Angular, that simplify and accelerate web development.
