Questio 2:  Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. 
Provide examples of situations where you would use each.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
✔ JavaScript:
-------------

1.Programming language: JavaScript is a high-level programming language used for adding interactivity  and functionality to web pages.

2.Dynamic behaviour: JavaScript allows you to create dynamic elements and behaviors on a webpage. For 
example, you can validate form inputs, create animations, or update content in real-time based on user 
actions.


3.Variables and Logic: JavaScript includes variables, data types, and control structures like loops and 
conditionals, enabling you to create complex logic and algorithms.


4.Client-side: JavaScript runs in web browsers, making it a client-side technology. It executes on the user's 
device, enabling real-time user interactions.

✔ HTML:
-------
1.Markup language: HTML is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on web pages.


2.Static structure: HTML defines the static structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, 
and images.


3. Tags and Elements: HTML uses tags (e.g., <div>, <p>, <a>) to create elements that structure the content and 
provide semantic meaning.


4.Content Prestation: HTML's primary role is to define the content's structure and semantics, which browsers 
render as a web page
