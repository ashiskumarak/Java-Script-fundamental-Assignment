Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and 
multi-line comments.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments in JavaScript are essential for code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers. They serve several important purposes:

1. Comments provide explanations and context about the code's purpose, logic, and functionality. This makes it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand and work with the code.

2. Comments can be used to temporarily disable or "comment out" code during debugging, helping you isolate issues without deleting code.

3. Comments allow developers to communicate with each other, explaining why certain decisions were made or describing how specific code segments work.

4. Comments can be used to divide code into logical sections, making it easier to navigate and maintain larger codebases.

5. In some cases, comments may be required to explain licensing, copyright information, or compliance with regulations.

Ex:
//single line comment
let age=45;

/*
Multile comment
multiline

*/
 - Clear and well-maintained comments can significantly improve the 
readability and maintainability of your JavaScript code.
